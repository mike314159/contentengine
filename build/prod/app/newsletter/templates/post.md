### This Weeks Tip

**Re-balance Your Portfolio Periodically**

Re-balancing your portfolio is like pruning a garden: as some investments grow faster than others, your original mix shifts, potentially throwing your risk and return goals out of balance. By periodically buying low and selling high—trimming back assets that have ballooned and adding to those that lag—you maintain the risk profile you're comfortable with and avoid unintended exposures that market moves can sneak in. This disciplined practice not only tames emotional reactions during volatility but can also enhance long-term returns by keeping your strategy aligned and your financial goals firmly in view.
