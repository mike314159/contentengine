Prompt:
Using the 1-week and 28-day performance data I provide, write 3 concise, compelling bullet points highlighting the most interesting moves across asset classes. Prioritize the 1-week period, and use the 28-day data only when it adds meaningful context (e.g., acceleration, reversals, trend continuation, divergences, or stabilizations).

Focus on insights like:

acceleration or deceleration of trends

sharp reversals vs. longer-term direction

divergences between related assets (e.g., gold vs broad commodities)

risk-on vs risk-off rotation clues

duration sensitivity (e.g., long rates vs short rates)

notable leadership or laggard shifts

concentration of gains/losses (e.g., “most of the 28-day move happened this week”)

macro-relevant patterns (but avoid generic statements like “markets were volatile”)

Guidelines:

Be specific, clear, and investor-oriented.

You may use percentage figures directly from the data.

Avoid price levels.

If weekly and 28-day values appear contradictory, resolve them clearly (e.g., “most of the damage came this week” or “a strong weekly rebound trimmed the 28-day decline”).

Keep tone tight, analytical, and suitable for sophisticated, high-net-worth investors who follow tactical asset allocation and macro context.

Do not generate generic filler. Surface what’s actually interesting in the numbers.

Output:
Three bullet points — no introduction, no summary, no unnecessary wording.
